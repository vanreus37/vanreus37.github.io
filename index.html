                <p id="info"> Picnic is rethinking the way people buy food. Without physical stores,
                    we use an app-only approach and a user-centric philosophy, to make 
                    grocery shopping quick, simple, and fun.
                    
                    Starting in one Dutch 
                    town in 2015, we now serve over 100 cities in both the Netherlands and 
                    Germany. The secret to our success? An end-to-end business and a 
                    just-in-time supply chain. From the app-only store, forecasting of 
                    orders, warehouse fulfillment, to the evolving distribution strategy of 
                    our fleet of electric vehicles, we build everything in-house on our own 
                    software.
                    
                    The team has expanded from 10 to over 300 in 4 years. 
                    Growth has been exponential and weâ€™re not the only ones to say so. With 
                    multiple awards to our name and a Series C funding round of 250 million,
                     we have become true disruptors in some of the most challenging 
                    industries: inner-city logistics, e-commerce retail, and enterprise 
                    software. And thanks to our people-first attitude and a friendly 
                    delivery team, we become an integral part of every neighborhood we 
                    serve.
